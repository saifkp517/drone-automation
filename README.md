# Drone Control Simulation

This project simulates drone control using a Python script to send commands to the drone's microcontroller over virtual serial ports. This README provides instructions for setting up the server and client, controlling the drone, and running the simulation.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- `socat` utility for virtual port communication
- PX4 Autopilot
- Micro-XRCE-DDS for DDS communication
- Additional dependencies may be required; see [installation](#installation) steps below.

## Installation

1. Clone the necessary repositories for the server and client.

### Starting the Server

1. Clone the Micro-XRCE-DDS repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eProsima/Micro-XRCE-DDS.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the server directory and start the Micro XRCE Agent:
   ```bash
   cd Micro-XRCE-DDS-Agent
   MicroXRCEAgent udp4 -p 8888
   ```

### Starting the Client

1. Clone the PX4 Autopilot repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot
   ```
2. Navigate to the PX4 directory and start the simulator:
   ```bash
   cd ~/PX4-Autopilot
   make px4_sitl gz_x500
   ```

### Starting the Drone Control Program

Run the Python script that controls the drone:
```bash
python3 drone.py
```

## Virtual Port Setup

To simulate communication between the drone's microcontroller and the controlling device, set up virtual serial ports using `socat`.

1. Start the virtual ports:
   ```bash
   socat -d -d pty,rawer,echo=0 pty,rawer,echo=0
   ```
   This command creates two virtual ports and provides output similar to:
   ```
   2024/11/11 13:52:00 socat[5281] N PTY is /dev/pts/1
   2024/11/11 13:52:00 socat[5281] N PTY is /dev/pts/2
   ```

2. Note the paths (`/dev/pts/1` and `/dev/pts/2`). These will need to be configured in both `drone.py` and `sendsignal.py`.

## Code Modifications

### Updating the Serial Ports

In `drone.py` and `sendsignal.py`, update the `serial.Serial` line to match the virtual port paths. For example:
```python
with serial.Serial('/dev/pts/4', baudrate=9600, timeout=1) as ser:
```

### File Descriptions

#### `drone.py`

This file contains the main program to control the drone. The script reads and writes data over a serial connection and uses threading to handle serial I/O separately.

#### `sendsignal.py`

This file runs on a remote machine to send commands to the drone. Update the `serial.Serial` line to use the appropriate virtual port.

## Running the Signal-Sending Program

Start `sendsignal.py` on a separate machine to send commands to the drone:
```bash
python3 sendsignal.py
```

### Control Commands

- `m` - Switch to manual control mode
- `e` - Switch back to the drone's autonomous plan
- `w`, `a`, `s`, `d` - Move the drone forward, left, backward, and right

These commands are sent from `sendsignal.py` to control the drone remotely.

## Additional Information

For development and debugging, the serial communication is tested in a simulated environment. Commands are sent via `sendsignal.py`, which communicates with the drone through virtual serial ports.
